# Implementation Plan

## Version 1 (MVP) - Basic Webcam Setup
- Set up basic Streamlit app
- Implement webcam access and display
- Test basic image capture
- Learning focus: Streamlit basics and webcam integration

## Version 2 - Hand Detection
- Add MediaPipe hand detection
- Display hand landmarks on video feed
- Simple UI to show detection status
- Learning focus: MediaPipe hand tracking

## Version 3 - Single Letter Recognition
- Implement recognition for 3-4 simple letters (A, B, C)
- Add basic feedback (correct/incorrect)
- Simple practice interface with fixed letters
- Learning focus: Basic gesture recognition logic

## Version 4 - Full Alphabet
- Expand recognition to all 26 letters
- Improve feedback visualization
- Add practice mode with letter selection
- Learning focus: Model training and recognition

## Version 5 (Stretch Goals)
- Add basic error statistics
- Improve UI/UX
- Add help/instructions
- Learning focus: UI/UX improvements

## Development Notes
- Use simple libraries (Streamlit, MediaPipe, OpenCV)
- Focus on learning, not production quality
- Test with basic use cases only
- Keep processing local and simple
