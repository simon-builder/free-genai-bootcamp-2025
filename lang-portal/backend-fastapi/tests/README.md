the following assumptions have been made for this implementation.

## Goal
Ensure application reliability through automated testing with minimum 70% code coverage.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit tests implemented for models, routers, and schemas
- [ ] Test coverage reaches minimum 70%
- [ ] Tests pass successfully with pytest

## Constraints
- Focus on unit tests only for first version (no integration/e2e tests yet)
- Limited to backend FastAPI application
- Use pytest framework

## Additional Information

## Personal Learning Goals
- Learn effective unit testing patterns for FastAPI
- Understand test coverage tools and reporting
- Gain experience with test-driven development
